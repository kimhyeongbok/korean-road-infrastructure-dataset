## Introduction
We collected over two million high-resolution (3328Ã—1872) frames using nine survey vehicles equipped with camera and GPS sensors. From these, 200,000 frames were refined and annotated with:
- **34 distinct facility types** (e.g., traffic signals, guardrails, tunnels, etc.)
- **2,676,583 labeled instances** (bounding boxes and polygon annotations)
- Coverage of **highways, national roads, and local roads** in both **city and non-city** areas

The dataset supports tasks such as object detection and segmentation, aiming to advance road safety asset management, intelligent transportation systems, and autonomous driving research.

## Sample Dataset Download
We have provided a **480MB** sample dataset for quick exploration.

- **[Download Sample Dataset (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BAdLggaiQaVZGeg28dY7paguXNcEV-lX/view?usp=drive_link)**

This sample includes a subset of images and annotations (bounding boxes + polygons), along with a JSON file in a COCO-like format.  
**De-identification** is applied to ensure privacy (faces, license plates, etc. are blurred).
